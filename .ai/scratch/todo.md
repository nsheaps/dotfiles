- [x] Review rc.d/00_setup_symlinks.sh changes (RC symlinks commented out)
- [ ] Update rc.d/00_setup_symlinks.sh link() to make repo source of truth
- [ ] Update direnv logic in rc.d/ for new RC file design
- [ ] Run bin/wire to create symlinks and sync RC files
- [ ] Test shell initialization in new terminal
- [ ] Clean up unused files (_home/.zshrc.d directory)
- [ ] Remove shellrc.d sourcing logic from ~/.zshrc (dead code cleanup)
- [ ] Design improvements for hook reminders to prevent duplicate firing (requires Plan agent + claude-code-guide agent to research Claude Code hooks documentation and architect a better design)
- [ ] Note: Use AskUserQuestion when you need to block and wait for user input - it's preferred over questions.md for blocking questions. questions.md is for async communication that doesn't block progress.
